# Superdry Java Project
```
1. Could you write a Java program that parse a text and output how many time each work occurs in a sentence. 
For example, the sentence : “this is a dog and this is a cat” should produce : 
This : 2
Is : 2
A : 2
Dog : 1
And : 1
Cat : 1
(the format in itself do not matter)
Additionally, can you sort the output by alphabetical order and reverse alphabetical order.
```
```
2. If you are given a number and 4 other numbers, can you design a program that gives the exact operations required to achieve the result.
For example, 16 and (1,3,4,5) could produce as a result : 3 * 4 + 5 - 1 
Only consider the operators : + - * and () 
The divide is NOT to be considered.
(Easier option : + - and  * only, process elements left to right without taking care of the priority of operations).
```
